# ToDoLy

*ToDoLy is a To Do list organizer app.* Its basic purpose is to keep track of tasks, print out various lists of tasks and remind user of upcoming tasks.

### How it works
When started, program prints a welcome screen which includes:
- Count of finished and unfinished tasks
- A remainder for overdue tasks
- Daily agenda  

Next, it prints a functional menu and waits for user to select an option.

</p>

The *View task* and *View multiple tasks* options provide user with similar submenus that offer to edit or remove selected task or group of tasks. Until "exit" is selected, functional menus will be printed after every executed command.

## Code
*ToDoLy* is written in Java. It is based on *MVP (Model View Presenter) pattern* represented by *ToDoLy's MVP diagram*

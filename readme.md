# ToDoLy

*ToDoLy is a To Do list organizer app.* Its basic purpose is to keep track of tasks, print out various lists of tasks and remind user
of upcoming or overdue tasks.

### How it works
When started, program prints a *Welcome Menu* which includes:
- Count of finished tasks
- Count of unfinished tasks
- A remainder for overdue tasks
- Daily agenda

Next, it prints functional *Menu* and waits for user input. The menu includes options to:
- Print an agenda
- Add a new task
- View task (Task is searched by name)
- See all tasks
- Remove finished tasks
or
- Exit

The *View task menu* has a similar submenu that offers to edit or remove selected task.
//TODO change when *continue* is added
Until "exit" is selected, the functional menu will be printed after every executed command.

## Code
*ToDoLy* is written in Java. It is based on *#MVP# (Model View Presenter) pattern* represented by *ToDoLy's MVP diagram*
//TODO fix short link

#ToDoLy

*ToDoLy* is a TO DO app. Its basic purpose is to keep track of tasks, print out various lists of tasks and remind user
of upcoming or overdue tasks.

##How it works
When started, program prints a *Welcome Menu* which includes:
- Count of finished tasks
- Count of unfinished tasks
- A remainder for overdue tasks
- Daily agenda

Next, it prints functional *Menu* and waits for user input. The menu includes options to:
- Print an agenda
- Add a new task
- View task (Task is searched by name)
- See all tasks
- Remove finished tasks
or
- Exit

The *View task menu* has a similar submenu that offers to edit or remove selected task.
Until "exit" is selected, the functional menu will be printed after every executed command.
//TODO change last sentence when *continue* is added
